# Habit Tracker

Habit Tracker is a simple and interactive web application built with React, designed to help you create, track, and maintain your daily habits. Whether you're working on personal growth, fitness goals, or productivity, this app allows you to monitor your progress and stay motivated. The app uses localStorage to save your data, ensuring it persists even after you close and reopen the app.

## Features

- **Add New Habits**: Easily add new habits with a name to start tracking them.
- **Track Habit Completion**: Mark a habit as completed for the day and track how many days you've successfully completed it.
- **Delete Habits**: Remove any habit you no longer wish to track.
- **Persistent Data**: Your habit data is stored locally using the browser's localStorage API, so it remains intact between sessions and page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is built to work on both desktop and mobile devices, making it accessible anywhere, anytime.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's perfect for creating dynamic and responsive web apps like this one.
- **localStorage**: A web storage solution that allows data to persist in the browser even after a page refresh. It helps store habit data locally so users don't lose their progress.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for making the app visually appealing and user-friendly.
